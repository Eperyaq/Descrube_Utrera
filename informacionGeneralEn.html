        <p>Utrera is one of the most important cities in the province, due to its wealth, its past, and its heritage. Located 24 km from the capital, even before entering it, the importance of its buildings surprises; and upon entering, its manor houses, churches, and convents are surprising.

            Among the most notable monuments are the Castle, the Parish Church of Santiago el Mayor, the Parish Church of Santa María de la Mesa, the Sanctuary of Consolation, the Convent of the Purísima Concepción, the House of Arias Saavedra, the Riarola House, or El Niño Perdido.
            
            In its municipal area is the Natural Reserve of the Utrera Endorheic Complex, formed by the lagoons of Alcaparrosa, Arjona, and Zarracatín, and of great importance due to its marsh vegetation and avifauna.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The first settlements date back to prehistoric times. Numerous remains from the Neolithic and the Iberian period have been found.
            During the Roman period, Pliny placed it among the most notable in Baetica. It was called Castro Vinaria. Although no remains of the Roman city have been found, the magnitude of its necropolis gives us an idea of the importance of the city.
            After the Christian conquest, carried out by King Fernando III, in 1253 Alfonso X distributed the lands, building a walled fortress. It fell again into the hands of the Muslims in the year 1340. It was definitively conquered by the Infante Don Juan Manuel in the times of Alfonso XI. It would be destroyed by Mohamed V in the year 1368. Enrique II had to increase its privileges to facilitate its repopulation.
            After the War of Granada, during the 16th and 17th centuries, it underwent great urban development.
            The War of Independence was a hard blow. Its recovery would be slow throughout the 19th century.</p>
